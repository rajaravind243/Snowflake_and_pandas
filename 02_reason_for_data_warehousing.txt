Reasons that we invest the time, resources and money into building a data warehouse.
1. Making data - driven decisions 
    -- To support making decisions in a data driven manner rather than having to rely solely on experience and intuition and even hunches.
2. One stop shopping.  
    -- the data that we need is all in a single location rather than scattered among the transactional and operational applications where we get    
       that data from 
1. Making data - driven decisions 
    For making data driven decisions. Ideally, we need a view into 
        -- the past, 
        -- the present and
        -- the future or what we believe the future will likely be (with regards to various areas of our organizations)
        -- the Unknown (We also even need a view into the unknown)
    By powerful analytics we will get some interesting and important infor from all of this data.
    Business intelligence and data warehousing both came onto the scene around the same time right around 1990 and provided tremendous synergy for
    each other.
    Arguably, B.I helped to make data warehousing extremely popular and data warehousing helped do the same for B.I.
2. One stop shopping
    back before data warehouses (one stop shopping) came onto the scene.
      -- Any attempted data driven decision making require going after data, either in the original applications themselves or in what we call 
         extract files that drew data from one or perhaps a couple of those applications.
      -- But for the most part, data driven decision making back in the old days was incredibly tedious and problematic 
         because of the data we needed being scattered all over the place.
    With data warehousing, though, we integrate all of the data into one place and provide the aforementioned one stop shopping.
    So what we can do then is concentrate on the analysis of the data rather than repeatedly gathering and integrating the data over and over.
    So again, we have business intelligence and data warehousing as sort of sibling disciplines that provide tremendous value to each other 
    and to all of us who use data warehousing.
